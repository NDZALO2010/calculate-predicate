# Predicate Calculator Web App

This is a simple web application that calculates a predicate score based on weighted marks from semester tests, class tests, and an assignment.

## Description

The app takes input for:
- 2 semester test marks (weighted 60%)
- 5 class test marks (weighted 30%)
- 1 assignment mark (weighted 10%)

It calculates the final predicate score by applying the respective weights to the average of the semester tests, the average of the class tests, and the assignment mark.
